/*
 * A struct representing an active postmaster child process.  This is used
 * mainly to keep track of how many children we have and send them appropriate
 * signals when necessary.  All postmaster child processes are assigned a
 * PMChild entry.  That includes "normal" client sessions, but also autovacuum
 * workers, walsenders, background workers, and aux processes.  (Note that at
 * the time of launch, walsenders are labeled B_BACKEND; we relabel them to
 * B_WAL_SENDER upon noticing they've changed their PMChildFlags entry.  Hence
 * that check must be done before any operation that needs to distinguish
 * walsenders from normal backends.)
 *
 * "dead-end" children are also allocated a PMChild entry: these are children
 * launched just for the purpose of sending a friendly rejection message to a
 * would-be client.  We must track them because they are attached to shared
 * memory, but we know they will never become live backends.
 *
 * child_slot is an identifier that is unique across all running child
 * processes.  It is used as an index into the PMChildFlags array.  dead-end
 * children are not assigned a child_slot and have child_slot == 0 (valid
 * child_slot ids start from 1).
