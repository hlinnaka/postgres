/*
 * TopoSort -- topological sort of a wait queue
 *
 * Generate a re-ordering of a lock's wait queue that satisfies given
 * constraints about certain procs preceding others.  (Each such constraint
 * is a fact of a partial ordering.)  Minimize rearrangement of the queue
 * not needed to achieve the partial ordering.
 *
 * This is a lot simpler and slower than, for example, the topological sort
 * algorithm shown in Knuth's Volume 1.  However, Knuth's method doesn't
 * try to minimize the damage to the existing order.  In practice we are
 * not likely to be working with more than a few constraints, so the apparent
 * slowness of the algorithm won't really matter.
 *
 * The initial queue ordering is taken directly from the lock's wait queue.
 * The output is an array of PGPROC pointers, of length equal to the lock's
 * wait queue length (the caller is responsible for providing this space).
 * The partial order is specified by an array of EDGE structs.  Each EDGE
 * is one that we need to reverse, therefore the "waiter" must appear before
 * the "blocker" in the output array.  The EDGE array may well contain
 * edges associated with other locks; these should be ignored.
 *
 * Returns true if able to build an ordering that satisfies all the
 * constraints, false if not (there are contradictory constraints).
